## Abstract
We propose a general framework to estimate the thermal-related transition behaviors of a finite statistical system, both microscopically and macroscopically. We utilize deep-learning explicit density generative models to model the distribution of the systems. Along with the microscopic states, the temperature is also used to estimate the probability. When optimized with the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, at optimal point, this learnt distribution can be proved to be a temperature-continuous Boltzmann distribution. This training requires no dataset, only the energy function. Besides being a direct sampler of the microscopic states, the learnt model gives temperature-continuous estimations of the systemâ€™s macroscopic properties, e.g., the partition function. With the help of the automatic differentiation, these continuous estimations can be differentiated in a way similar to what one can do with an analytical solution. To show the generality of the proposed method, we demonstrate this framework on the phase transition of Ising model (discrete-variable model with PixelCNN) and XY model (continuous-variable model with Normalizing flow).
